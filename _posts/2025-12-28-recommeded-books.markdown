A couple of books that I have read and I think bring value to any aspiring software engineer and software architect:

- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
- Release It
- Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans
- The Mythical Man-Month by Brooks
- Software Architecture in Practice
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
